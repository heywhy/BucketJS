BucketJS:
* it tries to help you make your codes well organised i.e. a class per file
* trying to implement Namespacing in the otger languages


Its very basic to use:
* Include the src/Bucket.js file in your page and you are set to use it.
* The dist directory consists of the different aspects implemented into the library

Examples are found in the tests folder

if you think the project worths it, you can break
the library and you can contribute to it.
